We have worked in a group of 4 to find out the vulnarabilities in a website called osCommerce.

We Use many tools some of them are kali Linux, Nmap, Nessus Scanning, Wire Shark, dirsearch, etc.

We performed Attack Vectors such as Tautology attacks on login, search criteria and advanced search page, 
also performed union, piggy backed attack, etc. on certain attack vector to check for vulnerabilities,
and dirsearch to find the different endpoints that we can access in this website.

We have found many vulnerabilities such as pache version vulnerability, PHP Version vulnerability, weak hashing algorithm vulnerability, 
Remote Command Execution, etc.

We applied Mitigation to solve all identified vulnerabilities.
